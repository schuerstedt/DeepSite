## Style Application

### How Styles Work
- Styles are applied through enhanced AI prompts that guide the design generation
- Each style includes specific instructions for visual elements, colors, and aesthetics
- The AI interprets these style guidelines while implementing your functional requirements

### Style Persistence
- Your selected style is remembered across sessions using localStorage
- The style applies to both initial website generation and follow-up edits
- You can change styles at any time during the design process

### Combining Styles with Prompts
- The style selector enhances your existing prompts
- Your functional requirements remain the primary focus
- Style instructions are added as additional context for the AI

## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Style

## Technical Implementation

### Files Structure
- `lib/design-styles.ts` - Style definitions and configurations
- `components/editor/ask-ai/style-selector.tsx` - UI component for style selection
- Integration in `components/editor/ask-ai/index.tsx` - Main AI interface

### Style Configuration
Each style includes:
- **ID**: Unique identifier
- **Name**: Display name
- **Description**: User-friendly explanation
- **Prompt**: AI instruction text
- **Category**: Grouping for organization
- **Icon**: Visual indicator

### Customization
Developers can easily add new styles by:
1. Adding entries to `DESIGN_STYLES` array
2. Creating new categories in `STYLE_CATEGORIES`
3. Defining appropriate AI prompt instructions

## Troubleshooting

### Style Not Applied
- Verify style selector shows your chosen style
- Check if prompt includes style requirements in API network tab
- Try being more specific in your functional prompt

### Unexpected Results
- Some styles may interpret prompts differently
- Try adjusting your prompt to be more explicit about desired functionality
- Consider switching between Classic and Enhanced prompt modes

### Style Conflicts
- If mixing multiple styling requests in prompt, the style selector takes precedence
- Remove style-specific language from your prompts and rely on the selector

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Custom style creation and saving
- Style preview examples
