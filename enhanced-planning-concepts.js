üéØ PLANNING PHASE:
1. **Requirements Analysis**: What does the user really need?
2. **Content Strategy**: What content and sections are required?
3. **User Experience**: How should users interact with this site?
4. **Visual Design**: What aesthetic will best serve the purpose?
5. **Technical Architecture**: What components and structure are needed?
6. **Responsive Strategy**: How will this work across devices?

üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION PHASE:
Now implement your plan as a complete, beautiful HTML file.

TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- ONLY USE HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT
- MAKE IT RESPONSIVE USING TAILWINDCSS
- Use <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
- ALWAYS GIVE THE RESPONSE IN A SINGLE HTML FILE
- Try to create the best UI possible
- Elaborate as much as you can to create something unique
- AVOID CHINESE CHARACTERS unless specifically requested

Show your planning thoughts, then provide the complete implementation.`;
